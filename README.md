# Figma Mini Project - 3D Cupcake Animations

## Overview:
This project focuses on creating simple 3D animations of a cupcake using Figma. The goal is to showcase the versatility of Figma in creating engaging and visually appealing animations.

## Project Components:
1. **Cupcake Design:**
   - Start by designing a cute and vibrant 3D cupcake. Use Figma's design tools to create a visually appealing cupcake with icing, toppings, and a base.

2. **Frames and Layers:**
   - Organize your design into frames and layers. This will help in managing and animating different components of the cupcake separately.

3. **Basic Animations:**
   - Experiment with basic animations like rotation, scaling, and opacity to bring your cupcake to life. Figma's animation tools make it easy to create smooth transitions.

4. **Interactive Elements:**
   - Introduce interactivity by linking frames. For example, clicking on the cupcake could trigger an animation, simulating user engagement.

5. **Exporting and Sharing:**
   - Once satisfied with your 3D cupcake animations, explore Figma's export options. You can share the project link or export GIFs or videos to showcase your work.

## Getting Started:

1. **Open the Figma File:**
   - Clone or download the Figma project file from the repository.

2. **Explore Layers and Frames:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the layers and frames structure. Each element of the cupcake should be organized and labeled appropriately.

3. **Edit and Customize:**
   - Modify the cupcake design or add your creative touch. Experiment with colors, textures, and shapes.

4. **Animate Components:**
   - Use Figma's animation features to add life to your cupcake. Test different animations and transitions to find what suits your design.

5. **Interactivity (Optional):**
   - If interested, explore adding interactivity. Link frames to simulate user actions and create a more dynamic experience.

6. **Export and Share:**
   - Export your final 3D cupcake animations in a format of your choice. Share the project link or showcase your work on social media.
